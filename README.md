# Tableau

| Project Link | Project Description | Dashboard Link |
|---|---|---|
| ü¶Ñ [Maven Unicorn Challenge](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Maven-Unicorn-Challenge) | Cleansed and transformed data on privately-owned companies (start-ups) valued at over $1 billion using Python. Visualised key insights using Tableau, including the timeline of valuations, the top 10 countries and investors with the highest valuations, the most successful unicorns, and the average time it takes to reach a $1 billion valuation. | [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/katie.huang/viz/UnicornCompanies_16502745371460/Unicorns?publish=yes) |



# Data Science

| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries |    
|---|---|---|---|
| üë©üèª‚Äçüíª [CS50P - Ongoing](https://github.com/katiehuangx/CS50P/blob/main/README.md) | Programming | This repo contains the solution to the problem sets in [Harvardx CS50P Introduction to Programming with Python](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-programming-with-python). | - | 


# Data Engineering

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| üöó [Uber Taxi](https://github.com/katiehuangx/data-engineering/tree/main/Uber%20Project) | May 2023 | Python, GCP (Storage, Compute Engine, BigQuery), Mage, Looker Studio | Developed and implemented an end-to-end ETL pipeline for processinsg NYC Trip Record data. The pipeline encompassed extracting raw data, performing data transformation using Python, applying fact and dimensional data modelling techniques, orchestrating the pipeline on Mage, and ultimately creating a dashboard using Looker Studio. |


# Deep Learning

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| ü§° <br> [Text to Emoji Generator](https://github.com/hanheeds/TextToEmoji) | June 2023 | Python (PyTorch), Jupyter Notebook | Created a powerful text-to-emoji generator using BERT, trained on a carefully curated dataset of Tweets and emotions. Achieved an F1 score of 0.7 for emotion classification. Employed various distance metrics to map emotions to emoji representations efficiently. |


# Software Development
